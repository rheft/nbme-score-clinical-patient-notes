    "### Competition/Problem Overview and Description\n",
    "When you visit a doctor, how they interpret your symptoms can determine whether your diagnosis is accurate. By the time they’re licensed, physicians have had a lot of practice writing patient notes that document the history of the patient’s complaint, physical exam findings, possible diagnoses, and follow-up care. Learning and assessing the skill of writing patient notes requires feedback from other doctors, a time-intensive process that could be improved with the addition of machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Until recently, the Step 2 Clinical Skills examination was one component of the United States Medical Licensing Examination® (USMLE®). The exam required test-takers to interact with Standardized Patients (people trained to portray specific clinical cases) and write a patient note. Trained physician raters later scored patient notes with rubrics that outlined each case’s important concepts (referred to as features). The more such features found in a patient note, the higher the score (among other factors that contribute to the final score for the exam).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, having physicians score patient note exams requires significant time, along with human and financial resources. Approaches using natural language processing have been created to address this problem, but patient notes can still be challenging to score computationally because features may be expressed in many ways. For example, the feature \"loss of interest in activities\" can be expressed as \"no longer plays tennis.\" Other challenges include the need to map concepts by combining multiple text segments, or cases of ambiguous negation such as “no cold intolerance, hair loss, palpitations, or tremor” corresponding to the key essential “lack of other thyroid symptoms.”\n",
    "\n",
    "In this competition, you’ll identify specific clinical concepts in patient notes. Specifically, you'll develop an automated method to map clinical concepts from an exam rubric (e.g., “diminished appetite”) to various ways in which these concepts are expressed in clinical patient notes written by medical students (e.g., “eating less,” “clothes fit looser”). Great solutions will be both accurate and reliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "If successful, you'll help tackle the biggest practical barriers in patient note scoring, making the approach more transparent, interpretable, and easing the development and administration of such assessments. As a result, medical practitioners will be able to explore the full potential of patient notes to reveal information relevant to clinical skills assessment.\n",
    "\n",
    "This competition is sponsored by the National Board of Medical Examiners® (NBME®). Through research and innovation, NBME supports medical school and residency program educators in addressing issues around the evolution of teaching, learning, technology, and the need for meaningful feedback. NBME offers high-quality assessments and educational services for students, professionals, educators, regulators, and institutions dedicated to the evolving needs of medical education and health care. To serve these communities, NBME collaborates with a diverse and comprehensive array of practicing health professionals, medical educators, state medical board members, test developers, academic researchers, scoring experts and public representatives.\n",

    "### Understanding the problem\n",
    "_In this competition, you’ll identify specific clinical concepts in patient notes. Specifically, you'll develop an automated method to map clinical concepts from an exam rubric (e.g., “diminished appetite”) to various ways in which these concepts are expressed in clinical patient notes written by medical students (e.g., “eating less,” “clothes fit looser”). Great solutions will be both accurate and reliable._  \n",
    "Based off of the information in that paragraph (taken from the overview) the general ask from the organizers is to identify the the rubric entities within the patient notes, or more generally known as NER, or \"Named Entity Recognition\".  \n",
    "\n",
    "The _incredibly oversimplified_ problem:  \n",
    "**Given a patient note, tag the natural language note with standardized clinical terms**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Example: “clothes fit looser” is tagged as \"diminished appetite\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### My Approach\n",
    "This problem is in essence an NER (Named-Entity Recognition) problem. I'll start by understanding the state of the data, how its stored/seperated across different file, what the data actually contains, etc. Im hoping that based off of this information I can formulate a _very basic_ approach that may or may not be effective and consider that our \"baseline\". I'll then move onto a more traditional NER approach that leverages a library like Huggingface's `transformers` library.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, given the time constraint, Ill take support the best performing model (baseline or Neural Net) and put it behind a fastAPI api."

    "During this exam, each test taker sees a Standardized Patient, a person trained to portray a clinical case. After interacting with the patient, the test taker documents the relevant facts of the encounter in a patient note. Each patient note is scored by a trained physician who looks for the presence of certain key concepts or features relevant to the case as described in a rubric. The goal of this competition is to develop an automated way of identifying the relevant features within each patient note, with a special focus on the patient history portions of the notes where the information from the interview with the standardized patient is documented.\n",

    "- Feature: A clinically relevant concept. A rubric describes the key concepts relevant to each case.\n",
